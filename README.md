The opioid epidemic has turned into one of the major public health catastrophes for this generation of Americans. Similar to what tobacco or HIV were to earlier generations, the opioid epidemic appears to be this era’s defining public health crisis.I want to see if it was possible to build a model to predict opioid-related mortality by State  since this type of model might give insights into where and how to target interventions.

## Data Collection:
